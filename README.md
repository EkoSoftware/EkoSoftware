- 👋 Hello everyone, I am Swedish Programmer @EkoSoftware.
-    I decided to join the opensource part of the internet to learn from others.
-    Hopefully my own projects can teach other users something too.   
- 👀 Im currently about 7 months into programming in Python.
-    Which i started on par with the beginnings of my studies to become a network technician.
-    I really enjoy finding out more about how the internet works in depth at a low level.  
- 🌱 For now i am in a phase of creating alot of projects, and then remaking them into better versions.
- 💞️ I may be interested in collaboration, feel free to contact me on Github. 
- 📫 I am currently only available on GitHub.
